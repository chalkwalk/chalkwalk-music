// The chords the band plays over.
//
// A chord here is an ABSOLUTE root pitch class plus an explicit list of chord
// tones, not a scale degree. That is deliberate and it is the whole reason this
// file exists rather than the bots reading degrees straight out of MusicalKey.
//
// A degree can only ever name a chord that is diatonic to the current mode. The
// interesting harmony is not: a tritone substitution has a root a tritone away
// from the degree it replaces, an altered dominant has tones that are in no
// mode of the key, and a borrowed chord is by definition from somewhere else.
// Representing chords as root-plus-tones means all of those are already
// expressible, and adding them later is new code in one function rather than a
// new model everywhere.
//
// See `realise` for where a substitution pass would go.
//
// JUCE-FREE, like `MusicalKey` beneath it. Both are used by the bots AND by the
// plugin's chat UI -- announcing a key and reading a chart are room features
// that work with no band present -- so they belong to neither, and this one's
// home is `chalkwalk-music`.
//
// It overlaps that library far less than it looks. The only shared idea is a
// chord, and `NoteStrength.h`'s `SoundingChord` is a PROJECTION of this one
// rather than a rival: its tones are a 12-bit pitch-class mask, which answers
// "is this note in the chord" and cannot express either thing `Chord` carries
// for notation -- an extension in its own register (a ninth is 14 semitones,
// not 2, because a chord that names one wants it voiced above the seventh) or
// a slash bass. Charts, bars, chord names, roman numerals, degree charts,
// voice leading and key inference have no counterpart there at all.
//
// Testable in the headless target.
